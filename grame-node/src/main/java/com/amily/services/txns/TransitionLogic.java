/**
 * Defines a type that can perform a specific kind of state transition
 * within the active node and transaction context, under two conditions:
 * 	 <ol>
 * 	     <li> Its {@code applicability} predicate evaluates to {@code true}
 * 	 	against the active transaction. </li>
 * 	    <li> Its {@code syntaxCheck} function evaluates to {@code OK}
 * 	    against the active transaction.</li>
 * 	 </ol>
 *
 * The context injects the {@link TransitionLogicLookup} with all
 * implementations of this type, so it is simple for the {@link ProcessLogic}
 * to find the right state transition after it validates that signing,
 * fee, and other generic prerequisites have been met.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b>	There is no strict contract on whether the syntax check
 * requires consensus to have been reached. However, it is recommended to
 * make the syntax check evaluate only conditions which are known
 * pre-consensus. Ultimately we may move all syntax checking outside the
 * {@link ProcessLogic}.
